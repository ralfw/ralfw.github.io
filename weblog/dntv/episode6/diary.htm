<h1>dotnet.tv 6 - WebServices</h1>
<h2>The dotnet.tv Diary</h2>
<p>We´ve done it again: Another installment of dotnet.tv - a video series for 
.NET Framework developers - is almost finished. Postproduction should be just 
some more 4 hours or so on next Tuesday.</p>
<p>But even though this is already the sixth installment of dotnet.tv (if you´re 
insterested in info on earlier installments, see
<a target="_blank" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ralfw/category/2141.aspx">their 
blog diaries</a> or visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dotnettv.de">
dotnet.tv homepage</a> at MSDN Online Germany) in some regards it again has been 
a new experience for us.&nbsp; For example, it´s the first installment we did in 
English. The reason for this: The topic is WebServices (thanks a lot to
<a target="_blank" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/">Christian Weyer</a> for 
allowing me to tap his &quot;knowledge base&quot; :-) during my work on the script) which is about 
communication standards and English is a international communictaion standard. 
But also we wanted to shoot at least once in English to make dotnet.tv 
accessible to a larger audience beyond the German speaking world.</p>
<h3>What is dotnet.tv?</h3>
<p>dotnet.tv is an educational video series for .NET Framework developers 
sponsored by the German software magazine
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dotnetpro.de">dotnetpro</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.msdnonline.de">MSDN Online of Microsoft 
Germany</a>. </p>
<p>dotnet.tv is produced by me, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ralfw.de/">
Ralf Westphal</a> (left; author, director, speaker), and
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.inlinenews.de">Sebastian Baumgartner</a> 
(right; camera, sound, editing):</p>

<p>Our goal with dotnet.tv is to educate and to entertain at the same time. Each 
installment of dotnet.tv so far is about a .NET Framework technology (e.g. .NET 
Remoting, Code Access Security, ADO.NET, WebServices) and of course delivers 
technical information. But rather than just sitting in an office and talking 
into the camera and maybe drawing some sketches on a whiteboard or sitting in 
comfortable chairs just chatting along we really try to illustrate what we´re 
talking about. We want to illustrate by finding analogies in the real world </p>
<p>

<i>dotnet.tv 3: Topic was .NET Enterprise Services, analogy here: Stateless Serviced Components 
can be compared to cheap personnell hired by hotels and the like for just one 
event. Such personnell does not keep any memory of what they have done at an 
event, and is instructed for each event anew.</i></p>
<p>and evoking emotions in our (mostly male developer) audience:</p>
<p>

<i>dotnet.tv 4: Our model clearly demonstrated what high fidelity data access with ADO.NET 
means (compared to former cursor based technologies like ADO) by providing a 3D reality view of what magazines for male readership can 
only show 2D pictures of.</i></p>
<p>
<img src="dntv6 (17).jpg" width="356" height="266"> <br>
<i>dotnet.tv 3: To exploit the whole spectrum of emotions, sometimes, though, we 
need to resort to showing inconvenient situations to effectively move the 
developer audience.</i></p>
<p>Our belief is, technical magazines and books do a good job of conveying 
facts. But technical magazines and books have a hard time to convey fundamental 
information, processes, anything involving several &quot;entities&quot; (e.g. PCs, 
people), as well as emotions. A technical artikel almost per definitionem is dry 
stuff.<br>
And live presentations at developer conference only marginally do better. 
Although they are able to evoke emotions in the audience through the speakers 
personality, they are limited in what can be done on stage.</p>
<p>So the reason why we believe in video to educate developers on certain 
aspects of their trade is, video is the most effective medium in some regards 
and is not used enough. But most importantly we think, it´s high time for some 
fun in our business. That´s the reason why we always try to strike a balance 
between sound technical information and entertaining elements in dotnet.tv. And 
so far the overwhelmingly positive feedback from the German developer community 
has assured us, we´re not too far off the mark with our efforts :-) </p>
<p>Each dotnet.tv installment is about 25 to 45min in time, contains spoken 
explanations, sometimes some acting, is shot at several locations with 
&quot;analogy-value&quot;, and shows graphics/code as needed. It´s published first in a 
dotnetpro issue on CD-ROM (as a 900kbps .wmv file) and a month later online at 
MSDN Online Germany (as 100kbps and 300kbps stream .wmv video file).</p>
<p>In addition, dotnetpro also publishes a short article along with each 
dotnet.tv installment to serve readers who prefer to read (first) about a topic.</p>
<p>And I try to document the production of each installment with diary postings 
in my weblog.</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>dotnet.tv is about WebServices. We decided to shoot in Hamburg - instead of 
Munich, our usual location -, because of some difficulties to coordinate our 
personal schedules but also because Hamburg is a city of many cultures, where 
communication across boundaries is part of everyday life. In line with our habit 
to place our presentation so to speak inside the analogy, we thus thought, the 
port of Hamburg would be a good symbol of cultural interaction.</p>
<p>Sebastian came a day early and stayed at my place. This not only made it 
easier in the morning to start right away, but also to work late (on another 
joint project) and party hard :-)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(5).jpg" width="263" height="350"><br>
<i>Sebastian still does not really know, what´s lying ahead of us. He´s still 
quite slaphappy (in a very original sense of the word, as it seems :-)</i></p>
<p>On dotnet.tv we started out with preparing the script and the shooting 
schedule. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(1).jpg" width="264" height="352"><br>
<i>Sebastian cuts the printed pages of the script. It´s 4 pages on a DIN A4 
sheet. Anything larger would be hard to carry around during shooting.</i></p>
<p>Contrary to our tight schedule I had written the longest script ever for a 
dotnet.tv installment resulting in some 160 cuts, 30-35min running time for the 
video, and new &quot;special effects&quot; like split screen we had never tried before. 
However, I tried to compensate for that with a new idea for shooting onscreen 
scenes and by limiting us to just 3 shooting locations, and just 2 &quot;actors&quot;.</p>
<p>Later on we went down to the port to shoot the first scenes. Incidentally 
this would also be the first scenes in the video, which makes it a little easier 
to get started, because then you can follow the flow of &quot;the story&quot; a little 
more. The day was beautiful.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(2).jpg" width="405" height="307"><br>
<i>View of the port of Hamburg with two museum ships.</i></p>
<p>After an early start, though, problems crept up pretty soon. When we reviewed 
the first couple of scenes shot, we realized a strange sound in our recording. 
Barely audible, but nevertheless annoying. After some time of identifying the 
source of this sound, we had to give up and seek help. Shooting had to be 
cancelled for the day :-( But we found a very cooperative guy, Volker, who was 
able to finally almost fix the problem.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(4).jpg" width="244" height="324"><br>
<i>Volker shows Sebastian the solution to our sound problem.</i></p>
<p>Volker only almost fixed the problem, because we had to reduce our noise 
filtering and still had to live with some, but very low sound. The final 
solution probably will be to exchange the camera, since it seems there is some 
hardware problem with it. (Too bad, it was our new camera, although, a used 
one.)</p>
<h3><b>Day 2</b></h3>
<p>The next day went as planned - but of course we were now almost a day behind 
schedule. We shot all of the scenes in the harbor. The day again was beautiful 
and I got a sunburn. Again it was much fun to enact what I had written before.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(18).jpg" width="347" height="279"><br>
<i>Eating a Hamburger when shooting in Hamburg had to be part of the video.</i></p>
<p>Sebastian as usual was responsible for camera and sound.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(3).jpg" width="351" height="264"><br>
<i>Sebastian is checking the wireless microphone we´re using. With just a team 
of 2 there is no boom operator, script girl or the like. On top of the camera 
sits our teleprompter with a sheet of my text.</i></p>
<p>Later on that day we met some colleagues who were in Hamburg to do a 
presentation before the local .NET user group. What a small world!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(15).JPG" width="348" height="262"><br>
<i>Michael Willers (newtelligence AG, middle) and Frank Prengel (Microsoft 
Germany, right) on their way to their presentation.</i></p>
<p>Then from 6pm on we did all scenes with the Sushi Bar. In this dotnet.tv 
installment a Sushi Bar represents a service offering. For this analogy I wanted 
the service provider and the service consumer to look as different as possible. 
So an asian delivery service seemed to work ok. (First I had thought about 
shooting at a McDonald´s restaurant, but then it seemed to be too complicated 
with all the hassle to get a permission, find a suitable &quot;actor&quot;, and shoot 
while customers line up around us.)</p>
<p>Fortunately I know an excellent Sushi Bar in Hamburg and the son of its 
owners was willing to act before the camera. He did a good job.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(16).JPG" width="283" height="213"><br>
<i>Our Korean &quot;actor&quot; did very well - except for his expressions of emotions. It 
had a hard time to show joy as well as anger. His explanation was: Asians (at 
least quite some) in general are less overt with their emotions.</i></p>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>Due to our delay we had to record the explanations from the off (to underly 
screenshots and graphics in the video) on day 3. So we went back to the port to 
get a consistent sound background. Since there is no budget for sound/text 
recording in a real studio, we need to do it that way in order to limit the 
&quot;sound jumps&quot; across cuts.</p>
<p>In addition to recording my text, though, we also jumped on the hydroplane 
which is based in Hamburg´s port, and took an airial sightseeing tour of 
Hamburg. It was absolutely great!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(10).jpg" width="354" height="266"><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(9).jpg" width="354" height="266"><br>
<i>A view of Hamburg from the hydroplane. Again a perfect day!</i></p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(11).jpg" width="356" height="269"><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(7).jpg" width="357" height="270"><br>
<i>Sebastian sat next to the pilot to make it easy for him to shoot with our 
camcorder.</i></p>
<p>Flying with a plane, climbing up a wall, or filming in rain and wind on top 
of a hill near the Munich olympic stadium certainly is part of the fun doing 
dotnet.tv is. Who wants to sit in a studio? Who wants to see someone sitting in 
a studio? :-)</p>
<p>

<i>dotnet.tv 2: There a several ways to gain meta information: Use Reflection or 
climb to the top of a hill.</i></p>
<p>Also on our schedule for day 3 were the scenes with our female &quot;actor&quot; 
representing a Sushi Bar customer. We shot them at my home in Hamburg, because 
Nicole´s kitchen was not large enough. To have a German blond girl with braids 
as a customer of Mr. Kim's Sushi Bar seemed a perfect contrast.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(13).jpg" width="349" height="461"><br>
<i>Sebastian wiring up Nicole with our microphone.</i></p>
<h3>Day 4 to 7</h3>
<p>As usual after 3 days we were finished with shooting at all locations except 
for on screen graphics. So we resorted to a nice café in Hamburg - the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.stadtcafe.com/">Stadtcafé Ottensen</a>, 
which is well known for it´s design created by the artist Friedensreich 
Hundertwasser.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(14).jpg" width="247" height="332"><br>
<i>Our editing room at the Stadtcafé Ottensen.</i></p>

<p>Since Sebastian knows the owners of the café/restaurant, we were allowed to 
sit on the first floor, which is closed for the public until 6 PM. This gave us 
some 8-10 hours a day to edit the video. But first we shot the explanatory 
screens to intermix with the live video scenes. </p>

<p>Also as usual we filmed them and did not capture them using some 
software/hardware. Although the quality so far had not been optimal (due to 
video compression small script had not been well legible), we still prefer 
filming the screens. During tests software capturing delivered even worse 
results, and hardware capturing is currently beyond our budget. </p>

<p>To make the screens/animations more appealing, this time we used quite 
dynamic camera motions. In terms of legibility the results seem to be quite 
good. But were excited to hear feedback from the audience.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="dntv6%20(6).jpg" width="250" height="328"><br>
<i>Our video editing setup. Foreground: Apple Powerbook with Final Cut Pro, 
background: Dell Laptop with Powerpoint :-)</i></p>

<p>Again, editing took much time. Although we streamlined the process a little 
bit by more clearly with improved notes on which takes during shooting were the 
best, we had more cuts to make, more special effects (like video overlaying), 
and some scenes where the final sequence had to be &quot;composed&quot; from lots of 
footage. Also difficult were scenes, were the spoken text from the off was much 
longer than the video material to overlay it. (I´ve to look out for that next 
time when writing the script.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the end we ran out of time and were not able to put in all 
the material we had shot. We had to leave out some 2-4 minutes on securing 
WebServices in order to make the deadline for delivering the video to dotnetpro. 
But we´ll put in those scenes for a &quot;director´s cut&quot; later next month.</p>

<p>The video will be released first in dotnetpro issue 6/04 and then be put 
online at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dotnettv.de">www.dotnettv.de</a>.</p>
